                        Animal Image Classification System
===========================================================================

This documentation provides an overview and usage guide for the Animal Image Classification System, which utilizes the ResNet50 architecture for 5-class classification of animal images.

1. Introduction:
   - The system is designed to classify images of animals into 90 different classes using the ResNet50 model.
   - 3-Fold cross-validation is employed to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Folder Structure:
   - The dataset is assumed to be organized in the following structure:
     - `train/` - Training images
     - `validation/` - Validation images
     - `test/` - Test images

3. Model Architecture:
   - The ResNet50 model is used for feature extraction.
   - A Global Average Pooling layer is added, followed by a Dense layer with softmax activation for classification.

4. Configuration:
   - Modify the `dataset_folder` and `input_folder` variables to set the paths to the dataset and input folders, respectively.
   - Adjust the `img_size`, `batch_size`, and `num_classes` variables based on your requirements.

5. 3-Fold Cross-Validation:
   - The system uses K-Fold cross-validation with 3 folds.
   - Training, validation, and test datasets are generated for each fold.

6. Training:
   - The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.
   - The number of epochs can be adjusted based on the training requirements.

7. Evaluation:
   - After training, the model is evaluated on the test set.
   - Test accuracy, confusion matrix, and model weights are saved for each fold.

8. Usage:
   - Execute the script, ensuring that the required libraries are installed.
   - Check the console for training and evaluation outputs.

9. Saved Model Weights:
   - Model weights for each fold are saved in the format: `resnet50_fold_<fold_number>.weights.h5`

10. Confusion Matrix:
   - A confusion matrix is generated for each fold, providing insights into classification performance.

11. Note:
    - Ensure that the directory structure, file names, and configurations align with your dataset and project requirements.
