                 Animal Image Classification System
=============================================================

1. Introduction:
   This folder contains the scripts and documentation for an animal image classification system using TensorFlow and ResNet50 architecture.

2. Scripts:
   - `One_vs_Rest.py`: Main script for model training and evaluation.

3. Dataset:
   - Ensure the dataset is organized in 'train', 'validation', and 'test' folders.
   - Subfolders within each folder should represent different animal classes.
   - Include a text file named "name of the animals.txt" in the 'input' folder with a list of animal names.

4. Usage:
   - Update the `dataset_folder` and `input_folder` variables in `One_vs_Rest.py`.
   - Execute `One_vs_Rest.py` to train and evaluate the model.

5. Model Output:
   - Model weights are saved in the same folder as the script after each fold.
   - Confusion matrices for each fold are printed during execution.

6. Adjusting Parameters:
   - Modify the batch size, epochs, or other parameters in `One_vs_Rest.py` as needed.
